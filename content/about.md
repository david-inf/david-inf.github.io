Hi, I'm **Dave** 👋

I'm an AI Engineering student passionate about deep learning foundations and natural language processing.

## What I Do

- ✍️ Working as Research Intern on optimization aspects of LLMs pretraining
- 📚 Pursuing a Master's degree in AI Engineering
- 💻 Building and experimenting with AI/ML systems
- 🔍 Looking for intern/junior opportunities in AI/ML/SWE for Spring/Summer 2026

<!-- ## Experience

<div class="compact-experience" style="margin:0;">
<p style="margin:0;"><strong style="color: #0969da;">AI Research Intern</strong> at <em>Mathematical Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Lab, LMU Munich</em> (Sep 2025 - Present)</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><em>Topic</em>: The go-to algorithm when training LLM is Adam, why is that? Is it possible to improve SGD so to gain insights of how such optimizers work for this class of problems?</p>
<ul style="margin:-15px 0 0 1.25rem; padding:15px;">
	<li>Worked on optimization techniques for large language models pretraining</li>
	<li>Implemented and tested novel algorithms to improve training efficiency</li>
</ul>
